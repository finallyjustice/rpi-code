In this code we try to pass parameters between two worlds and print them in the SMC code. 

SMC instruction is of the form : SMC #imm4
 -	imm4 value can be used by the smc handler but arm manual on SMC
  	calling conventions suggests us to use 0 for the imm4 value.
 - 	Parameters should be passed in the registers R0 - R3.
